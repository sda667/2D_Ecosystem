# Marine Life Ecosystem 2D Simulator

This project provides a 2D computer simulation of a marine ecosystem, aiming to model the complex biological interactions between species and environmental factors. It serves both scientific and educational purposes by offering insights into ecosystem dynamics, biodiversity, and the effects of various influences on ecological balance.

---

## Objective

Develop a simulation tool to model and analyze the behavior of marine ecosystems from both a theoretical and technical perspective.

---

## Background

Marine ecosystems are essential to life on Earth, contributing to:
- Climate regulation  
- Food supply  
- Biodiversity preservation  

Understanding these systems through simulation enables better scientific awareness and decision-making.

---

## Methodology

The project is organized around three core pillars:

### 1. Methodological Aspects
- Defines the project’s goals and modeling assumptions.
- Lays the groundwork for simulation parameters.

### 2. Theoretical Aspects
- Models the ecosystem's components: species, behaviors, and environment.
- Justifies modeling choices based on ecological principles.

### 3. Technical Aspects
- Implements simulation logic using Python.
- Modular architecture across models, visualization, and simulation control.

## Features

- Simulates interactions between marine species in a 2D grid.  
- Models biological phenomena: predation, competition, reproduction.  
- Visualizes population changes and ecological trends over time.
